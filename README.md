# EQUIPMENT-ASSET-FUEL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

This is a step by step process to visualize the fuel consumption for the container handling equipments in a terminal in Apapa Lagos.

To track the fuel consumption of container handling equipment compared to the number of containers lifted on a monthly basis.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The engineering management discovered that the records that shows rate of fuel consumption on the hardcopies were not accurate and updated regularly.

The management also noticed that most equipment consumption rate was higher than others of the same class with no means to show this information at a glance.

The monthly engineering meeting that needs the fuel records for proper planning were not getting the correct data, hence poor planning and running out of stock were inevitable.

The fuel dispensing station manager was given the responsibility to rectify the records.

I was contacted by the fuel station manager to analyse the available information and come up with a solution.

## PROJECT INSTRUCTION

      ● Review the current method of gathering the data.
        
      ● Provide and present the current year records on an excell spreadsheet.
     
      ● Analyse the data to show below KPIs:
      
            ● Total monthly fuel consumed
            ● Total monthly moves per equipment
            ● Fuel consumed per hour
            ● Average fuel consumed
            ● Total Moves per equipment
            ● Equipment hours worked in comparison with containers lifted
            
       ● Analyse the data to also to show the fuel consumption rate of other assets, such as; pool vehicles, generator, Fork lifts etc and this should be selected when needed.
       
## PROJECT INSIGHT

    ● There are 5 different types of container handling equipments.
      
    ● There are other asset that consumes fuel such as (vehicles, for lifts, Generators etc).
    
## PROJECT FOCUS

    1. Which equipments is the highest consumer of fuel.

    2. Which equipments is the lowest consumer of fuel.
    
    3. Display other assets that uses fuel.
    
    4. Display container handling equipment and other assets fuel consumptions on a separate pages.
    
## Data Set Description

The data set provided contains 6 sets of information that were consolidate to 3 sheets.

## Data Source

    ● Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://microsoft-excel.en.download.it/download)
         
## Data Analysis using MS Excel

    ● MS Excel Tables for data sorting, manipulating, cleaning and formatting
   
## Data Cleaning and Presentation using PowerBI

    ● Microsoft PowerBI [Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
   
    ● Powerquery was used structure the data futher and make it usaeabe in the PowerBI environment and then the charts were created.

    ● DAX was used to get new measures to show KPIs to be displayed in the PowerBI environment and then the charts were created.
     
## EXPOSITORY DATA ANALYSIS

The 3 sheets received from the fuel station manager were combined to one sheet for the presentation in PowerBI.

Interactive charts were created using the different build types;

Note: Individual colour codes was maintained in this report to show the gender types.

  1. A card visual was used to display the KPIs.
  2. Column charts were used to display monthly fuel consumptions.
  3. Bar charts were used to display the equipments with highest and lowest fuel consumption.
  4. Line and Column chart were used to display the equipment running hours to fuel consumption to container lifted.
  5. A pie chart was used to show a distribution of the groups of assest/ equipment and their consumption.
  6. A table was used to display the reason for high comsumtion
  7. Display the gender distribution in the organization, gender distribution regions and in departments:
